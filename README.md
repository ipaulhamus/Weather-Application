# Weather-Application
- *What is it?*
This project is a Weather Application written with JavaScript, providing users with real-time weather updates based on their location or searched city. 

This site features a simple and intuitive interface that displays current conditions, forecasts, and weather-related details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 

Users can log in using a secure username and password, which are stored in local storage for easy access during future sessions. To enhance user experience, the app also uses cookies to maintain session persistence, ensuring users remain logged in across different browsing sessions. 

This project demonstrates my ability to integrate weather APIs, handle user authentication, and implement client-side storage solutions.
